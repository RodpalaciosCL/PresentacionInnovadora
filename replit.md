## Deployment Configuration

### Current Support
The application supports deployment to multiple platforms with platform-specific optimizations:

#### Cloudflare Workers (Primary Deployment Target)
- **Full-stack Support**: Express.js backend runs natively on Cloudflare Workers with Node.js compatibility
- **Edge Distribution**: Global deployment with zero cold starts and automatic scaling
- **Configuration**: Uses `wrangler.toml` with `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connections via environment variables (supports Neon, PlanetScale, etc.)
- **Variables**: Environment variables accessible via `process.env` with Cloudflare secrets management
- **Build Process**: Frontend builds to `client/dist`, backend uses `httpServerHandler` wrapper with Node HTTP server
- **Performance**: 5-minute CPU time limit, supports WebSockets and server-sent events

#### Replit (Development Environment)
- **Development Tools**: Includes Replit-specific plugins for debugging and error overlays
- **Automatic Restarts**: Development workflow with hot module replacement
- **Configuration**: Uses development-specific middleware and in-memory storage
- **Environment**: HTTPS redirection and www subdomain handling for production previews

### Environment Variables Required
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string for production database
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)
- `SESSION_SECRET`: Secret key for session management
- Platform-specific variables handled through respective secret management systems

The development environment uses in-memory storage while production connects to a PostgreSQL database via environment variables. The application includes automatic platform detection and environment-specific optimizations.

### Cloudflare Workers Deployment Steps
1. **Build Frontend**: `cd client && npm run build` (outputs to `client/dist`)
2. **Install Wrangler**: `npm install -g wrangler` or use `npx wrangler`
3. **Configure Secrets**: `wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL` and `wrangler secret put SESSION_SECRET`
4. **Deploy**: `wrangler deploy` (builds and deploys both Express backend and static assets)
5. **Development**: `wrangler dev` for local Workers environment testing

Static assets are served by Wrangler's [assets] configuration, while API routes are handled by the Express server running in Workers with Node.js compatibility.
